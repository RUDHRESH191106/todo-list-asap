**Project Overview**

The To-Do List API is a RESTful backend service designed to manage tasks efficiently. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks while leveraging authentication to ensure security and task ownership. This project helps in understanding backend development fundamentals, including API design, database management, and authentication implementation.

**Key Features**

*User Authentication*

- Sign-up and sign-in functionality using email and password.

- Password hashing with bcrypt for security.

- JWT-based authentication for session management.

*Task Management*

- Create a new task with a title, description, and completion status.

- Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by its ID.

- Update task details or mark it as completed.

- Delete a task permanently.

*Optional Enhancements*

- Task ownership enforcement, ensuring users can only access their tasks.

- Task deadlines and reminders for better task tracking.

- Notifications for upcoming or overdue tasks.

**Tech Stack**

*Backend*: Node.js with Express.js

*Database*: MongoDB (Mongoose for schema and queries)

*Authentication*: bcrypt (for password hashing), JWT (for token-based authentication)

*Tools*: Postman (for API testing), Git (for version control)

*Frontend (Optional)*: React or HTML/CSS for task visualization
